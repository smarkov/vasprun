Installation
============

The package is intended for Python3

System install
--------------

You can install the script package via the standard 'python setup'
mechanism. If you want to install it system-wide into your normal
python installation, you simply issue::

  python3 setup.py

Local install
-------------

Alternatively, you can install it locally in your home space, e.g.::

  python3 setup.py install --user

Or if you want to tinker with the package::

  python3 setup.py develop --user

The executable ends up in $HOME/.local/bin, so if not already done,
add this directory to your path, e.g.(bash)::

  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
